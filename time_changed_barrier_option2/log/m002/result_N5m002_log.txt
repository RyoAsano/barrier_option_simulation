The computation is starting under the following paramters:
drift:0.02
volatility:0.2
maturity:1
initial value of the asset price:100
strike:100
barrier level:120

Also, we specified:
number of paths:1000
number of subdivisions:5

the variance is now  under estimation...

Computation is done.
The estimated mean is:8.5288
The estimated variance is:580.623
The computation time is:0 h. 0 m. 0s.
Would you also like to deduce the sample size?(Y/N)
Y
Henceforth we compute the neccessary sample path size to achieve the following inequality:
P[|MC-m|<e]>=p
where MC is the Monte--Carlo estimator m is the target mean, e is an accuracy and p is an acceptance level.
Accuracy(e)?
0.001
Acceptance level?(1:p=95% 2:p=99% 3:p=99.9%)
3
The required sample size is:6286737211

The computation is starting under the following paramters:
drift:0.02
volatility:0.2
maturity:1
initial value of the asset price:100
strike:100
barrier level:120
In this case, the true price is given by 7.93206.

Also, we specified:
number of paths:6286737211
number of subdivisions:5

the approximating value is now under computation...

Computation is done.
The approximating value is:8.07862
The true value is:7.93206
The absolute difference is:0.146563
The computation time is:1 h. 47 m. 45s.
